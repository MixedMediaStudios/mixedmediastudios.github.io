Right now Mixed Media has been contacted multiple times by people looking to make animations that are in a drawn form. Since we're structured more for titles and 3d modelling we've faced the choice of either having to turn the away or try to hire new artists. Given the frequency of this request we are going ahead with finding character artists. Anyone who thinks they are a good fit is welcome to join our team. Please note that this business is run solely by students looking to gain experience. This is not a job offer so much as it is an opprotunity to gain experience and make a little money on the side. We are really looking for someone who is:

* Willing to work for the hourly rates detailed on our [pricing page](/about)
* Has the ability to create non-moving AI files in a style that can be easily rigged for animation
* Regularly checks Email, Skype and/or Facebook
* Has a schedule free enough to take on new clients and make revisions for at minimum as 2-3 hours most days (we understand some days it won't happen)

If you think you are this person please feel free to <a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01D89iqJYnGqa2BPjsi-DvdQ==&amp;c=ZhZkPKYUsd4uqf_05MsBdIKvolGqQ-mTrar2eaJ7r0I=" onclick="window.open('http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k\07501D89iqJYnGqa2BPjsi-DvdQ\75\75\46c\75ZhZkPKYUsd4uqf_05MsBdIKvolGqQ-mTrar2eaJ7r0I\075', '', 'toolbar=0,scrollbars=0,location=0,statusbar=0,menubar=0,resizable=0,width=500,height=300'); return false;" title="Reveal this e-mail address">email us.</a> Just send us a bit of your work and what you can do. We'll be happy to send you any work we think best suits your abilities.
