Well... that went well. The AMA's we put on [/r/IAmA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2rjy47/iama_new_business_opening_today_by_redditors_for/) and [/r/CasualIAMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/2rkwgq/we_are_a_business_opening_today_by_redditors_for/) both went well. Here's some of our favorite questions (and their answers) in order of date.

> We are charging a flexible rate for each gif depending on complexity of the animation.

**Do you have any interesting stories you can tell us about getting this all put together?**

Turns out porn wasn't removed from the selections. Austin, instead of turning off that channel starts playing "smooth jazz" from his phone. Most awkward moment of my life.

**Do you have any examples of your work? Have any of your animations ever made the front page?**
